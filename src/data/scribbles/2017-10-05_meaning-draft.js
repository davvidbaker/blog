      I've made starts at this essay too many times. I think I do this when I am sad.

      How do I fight the nihilism that locks me up? That's what it really is.

      It's so hard to try to live a meaningful life when you know there is no meaning. I think that's a big problem that faces my generation. Maybe friends and family could bring back some meaning into my life.

Why? I'd like the world to be a more fun and friendly place? Maybe?

üïµ{I also just want to be happy}. And getting attention of any sort brings me happiness. Okay no not any sort. Positive attention.

People are doing things with their lives. And I am just sort of floating. I have no meaningful job. I have no girlfriend. The only girls in my life are ones I have built friendships with over years, really. I've fallen in love with ‚úç{all of them}(Okay, that's not really true. But some of them. It definitely reads nicer as "all".). I don't think I could ever tell them.`
